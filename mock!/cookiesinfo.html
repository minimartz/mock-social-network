<p>This page contains the information about our cookie use.<br />
For those of you who don't know what cookies are, according to Wikipedia:<br /><br />
A cookie, also known as an HTTP cookie, web cookie, or browser cookie, is usually a<br />
small piece of data sent from a website and stored in a user's web browser while a user<br />
is browsing a website. When the user browses the same website in the future, the data<br />
stored in the cookie can be retrieved by the website to notify the website of the<br />
user's previous activity.<br /><br />
Most websites use cookies--to see what cookies really do, if you clear your browsing history<br />
and start typing the URL of the website you cleared, the URL will show up as a suggestion.<br />
Your browser will say that you haven't been to the site, but the URL will show up because it is<br/>
stored as a cookie.<br /><br />
On Mock, whenever you click the logout button, the cookie we use to track what you're doing<br />
gets destroyed. You just have to make sure you don't post or tell anyone anything important, or anything valuable<br />
to someone else.<br /><br />-The Mock Team<br /><br />Last Updated Thursday, October 25th, 2012.
